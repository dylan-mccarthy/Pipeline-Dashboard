# GitHub Actions Pipeline Dashboard - Technical Specifications

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple web-based dashboard for monitoring GitHub Actions workflows across multiple repositories. The dashboard will connect to the GitHub API to fetch and display the latest status of workflows in real-time or on-demand.

## Features

- **Multi-Repository Support**: Monitor workflows from multiple GitHub repositories.
- **Workflow Status Display**: Show the latest run status for each workflow (success, failure, in-progress, etc.).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Optionally refresh data periodically to show live status.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access using GitHub OAuth or personal access tokens.
- **Filtering and Search**: Allow users to filter workflows by repository, status, or date.
- **Alerts/Notifications**: Basic notifications for failed workflows (future enhancement).

## Technical Requirements

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API endpoints and GitHub API integration.
- **Frontend**: React.js for the dashboard UI, with components for displaying workflow lists and statuses.
- **Database**: Optional, use MongoDB or SQLite for caching workflow data if needed.
- **Authentication**: GitHub OAuth 2.0 for user login and API access.
- **API Integration**: Use GitHub REST API v3 or GraphQL API to fetch workflow runs.
- **Deployment**: Host on Azure Static Web Apps or similar for simplicity.
- **Security**: Store sensitive data (tokens) securely, use environment variables.

## Architecture

- **Client-Server Model**: Frontend makes requests to backend, which proxies to GitHub API.
- **Data Flow**: User selects repositories → Backend fetches workflow data → Frontend renders status cards.
- **Scalability**: Start simple, scale with caching and pagination for large repos.

## Dependencies

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn for package management
- GitHub API libraries (e.g., @octokit/rest)
- React for frontend
- Express for backend

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables for GitHub tokens.
4. Run development server: `npm start`

## Future Enhancements

- Add CI/CD integration.
- Support for private repositories.
- Advanced analytics and reporting.

## Constraints

- Rate limits: Respect GitHub API rate limits (5000 requests/hour for authenticated users).
- Data Privacy: Ensure no sensitive data is exposed in the dashboard.
