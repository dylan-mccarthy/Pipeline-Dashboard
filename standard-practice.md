# Software Development Best Practices

This document outlines the core best practices to follow in this project to ensure high-quality, maintainable code and efficient collaboration.

## General Best Practices

- **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, and well-documented code. Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, configured in `.eslintrc.js`).
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes. Enforce minimum 80% test coverage via CI (configured in CI pipeline, e.g., GitHub Actions `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Block merges if coverage drops below threshold.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Commit frequently with descriptive messages following Conventional Commits.
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date. Update README, specs, and comments as needed.
- **Security**: Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords). Use environment variables. Run automated secret scanning (e.g., GitGuardian or GitHub Secret Scanning) on every PR.
- **Continuous Integration**: Ensure all changes pass CI checks before merging. Require passing CI, linters, and security scans (SAST/DAST) before merge.
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one team member. Require at least one approving review before merge (configured in branch protection rules).
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use pre-commit hooks (configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) to run linting, formatting, and unit tests before commits.
- **Branch Protection**: Enable branch protection on `main` (GitHub Settings > Branches): require PRs, status checks, and approvals; block direct pushes and merges on failing checks.

## Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive, lowercase branch names with prefixes to indicate the type of change:

- **Feature Branches**: `feature/<description>` - For new features (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`)
- **Bugfix Branches**: `bugfix/<description>` - For bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-login-issue`)
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/<description>` - For urgent production fixes (e.g., `hotfix/patch-security-vulnerability`)
- **Refactor Branches**: `refactor/<description>` - For code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/optimize-database-queries`)
- **Documentation Branches**: `docs/<description>` - For documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-api-docs`)

Branch names should be kebab-case, concise, and descriptive.

## Pull Request (PR) Process

All changes must go through a PR process to ensure quality and collaboration:

1. **Create a Branch**: Start from `main` (or current stable branch) and create a feature branch following the naming convention.
2. **Develop and Test**: Implement changes, write tests, and ensure everything works locally.
3. **Commit Changes**: Make frequent, small commits with clear messages following Conventional Commits.
4. **Push Branch**: Push your branch to the remote repository.
5. **Create PR**: Open a PR against the target branch (usually `main`). Use the standard PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) with sections for:
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of changes, rationale, and impact.
   - **Testing**: How the changes were tested, including unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing.
   - **Linked Issues**: References to related issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
   - Screenshots or demos if applicable.
6. **Code Review**: Request review from team members. Require at least one approving review from a code owner or senior developer (configured in `.github/CODEOWNERS`).
7. **CI Checks**: Ensure all required automated checks pass: CI builds, linters, security scans (SAST/DAST), and test coverage.
8. **Approval and Merge**: Once approved and all checks pass, merge the PR. Use "Squash and merge" by default to keep history clean. Use "Rebase and merge" for small, atomic changes or "Merge commit" for large features/releases to preserve history. Delete the branch after merge.
9. **Branch Protection**: Enforce rules on `main`: require PRs, status checks, and approvals; block direct pushes and merges on failing checks (configured in GitHub branch settings).

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or fix.
- Use draft PRs for work-in-progress.
- Respond promptly to review comments.
- Rebase or merge from main if there are conflicts.
- All required CI checks and at least one approval must pass before merging.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the complete Conventional Commit format to enable automated changelogs and releases. Enforce via commit linting (e.g., Husky + commitlint in `.husky/commit-msg` and `.commitlintrc.js`).

Format: `type(scope): short subject`

- **type**: Required. One of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`.
- **scope**: Optional. Module or component affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`).
- **subject**: Required. Concise description in imperative mood, no period.

Followed by a blank line, then optional:

- **Body**: Detailed description, rationale, and impact.
- **Footer**: Metadata like "Closes #123" or breaking changes.

For breaking changes, add `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` in the footer.

Examples:

- `feat(auth): add login endpoint`
- `fix(api): resolve null pointer in user service\n\nAdd null check for user object.\n\nCloses #123`
- `feat(ui): redesign dashboard\n\nImplement new responsive layout.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: removed deprecated CSS classes`

Keep messages concise but descriptive. This format enables automated versioning and release notes.

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance is not degraded
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable

## Deployment Practices

- Use automated deployments for staging and production.
- Tag releases with semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).
- Rollback plan for failed deployments.
