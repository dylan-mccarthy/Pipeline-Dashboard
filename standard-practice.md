# Software Development Best Practices

This document outlines the core best practices to follow in this project to ensure high-quality, maintainable code and efficient collaboration.

## General Best Practices

- **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, and well-documented code. Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript).
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes. Aim for high test coverage.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Commit frequently with descriptive messages.
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date. Update README, specs, and comments as needed.
- **Security**: Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords). Use environment variables.
- **Continuous Integration**: Ensure all changes pass CI checks before merging.
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one team member.

## Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive, lowercase branch names with prefixes to indicate the type of change:

- **Feature Branches**: `feature/<description>` - For new features (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`)
- **Bugfix Branches**: `bugfix/<description>` - For bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-login-issue`)
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/<description>` - For urgent production fixes (e.g., `hotfix/patch-security-vulnerability`)
- **Refactor Branches**: `refactor/<description>` - For code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/optimize-database-queries`)
- **Documentation Branches**: `docs/<description>` - For documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-api-docs`)

Branch names should be kebab-case, concise, and descriptive.

## Pull Request (PR) Process

All changes must go through a PR process to ensure quality and collaboration:

1. **Create a Branch**: Start from `main` (or current stable branch) and create a feature branch following the naming convention.
2. **Develop and Test**: Implement changes, write tests, and ensure everything works locally.
3. **Commit Changes**: Make frequent, small commits with clear messages (e.g., "Add user authentication logic").
4. **Push Branch**: Push your branch to the remote repository.
5. **Create PR**: Open a PR against the target branch (usually `main`). Include:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Screenshots or demos if applicable
6. **Code Review**: Request review from team members. Address feedback and make necessary changes.
7. **CI Checks**: Ensure all automated tests and checks pass.
8. **Approval and Merge**: Once approved, merge the PR using "Squash and merge" to keep history clean.
9. **Delete Branch**: After merging, delete the feature branch.

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or fix.
- Use draft PRs for work-in-progress.
- Respond promptly to review comments.
- Rebase or merge from main if there are conflicts.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow conventional commit format:

- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: resolve bug`
- `docs: update documentation`
- `refactor: improve code structure`
- `test: add tests`

Keep messages concise but descriptive.

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance is not degraded
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable

## Deployment Practices

- Use automated deployments for staging and production.
- Tag releases with semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).
- Rollback plan for failed deployments.
